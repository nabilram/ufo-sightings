# ufo-sightings

## Overview
* Opportunity to create app for UFO enthusiasts was provided.
* Raw JS data file with numerous objects containing UFO sighting data was also provided 
* Successful filter using date was created with button as D3.js event for action 
* For better utility adding more filters using the data features is needed 

## Results
* Enter desired filter/s on the lower left input boxes. Filters must:
    * Follow the format of the sample text/date
    * All in lower case
* Single or multiple filters may be used

## Results
* Drawback of this webpage
    * Subjective -- but theme is "too serious" and doesn't match the topic (UFO's)
    * Sites like these should be able to make fun of itself from time to time
* Possible improvements
    * text filter input by user should no be case sensitive
    * other versions or pseduonyms of filters should be usable, i.e us and usa
